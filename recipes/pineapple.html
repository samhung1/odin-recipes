    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Hawaiian pizza is a pizza originating in Canada,[1][2] traditionally topped with pineapple, 
        tomato sauce, cheese, and either ham or bacon.</p>
    <h2>ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>pizza dough</li>
        <li>Pizza sauce</li>
        <li>Mozzarella cheese, shredded</li>
        <li>Pineapple chunks (canned or fresh)</li>
        <li>Ham or Canadian bacon (optional)</li>
        <li>Olive oil</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven: Preheat your oven to the temperature specified in your pizza dough recipe or package instructions. Typically, it's around 450°F (230°C).</li>
        <li>Prepare the dough: If you're using pre-made pizza dough, follow the package instructions for rolling it out. Alternatively, you can make your own dough from scratch using your preferred recipe.</li>
        <li>Spread the sauce: Place the rolled-out dough on a pizza stone or baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Spread a layer of pizza sauce evenly over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges.     </li>
        <li>Add the cheese: Sprinkle a generous amount of shredded mozzarella cheese over the sauce, covering the entire pizza surface.</li>
        <li>Add the pineapple and other toppings: Distribute the pineapple chunks evenly across the pizza. If desired, you can also add ham or Canadian bacon for a classic Hawaiian-style pizza.</li>
        <li>Season: Drizzle a little olive oil over the pizza toppings, and sprinkle with salt and pepper to taste. This step is optional but can enhance the flavors.</li>
        <li>Bake the pizza: Place the pizza in the preheated oven and bake according to the dough recipe or package instructions, usually around 12-15 minutes. Keep an eye on it to prevent burning.</li>
        <li>Slice and serve: Once the cheese is melted and bubbly, and the crust is golden brown, remove the pizza from the oven. Let it cool for a few minutes, then slice it into wedges or squares. Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
